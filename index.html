            <h1>Happy life</h1>
            <p class="lead">Do you know what are the essential habits to have in <strong><em>your life</em></strong> so that you can live a happy lifestile? Maybe you are looking for a simple daily routine to follow, or good morning habits to set you up for a good day.</p>
            <p>In this article I gathered the results of many scientific studies, outlining some good personal habits that positively affect our emotional state and level of energy. This post is divided in body habits, mind habits, and life habits.

                Happiness, of “subjective well-being”,  is a state of mind—how we feel about ourself and our life. In this sense, anything we do can either makes us feel better or worse.</p>

                    <h4>Exercise Regularly</h4>

                    <p>In modern life we move our bodies less and less, and this has huge consequences for our physical and mental wellbeing.It’s not only for people who are obsessed with their bodies and self-image. Exercise releases proteins and endorphins in our brain, which makes us feel happier. It also makes us more productive at work. Exercise is essential for a happy life. </p>

                    <p>Huge topic, and one that people have strong opinions about. What is clear is that what you choose to eat not only affects your health, but also your moods. Drink more water,
                        practice cooking,
                        increase whole grains,
                        increase sweet vegetables,
                        increase leafy green vegetables,
                        eat less meat, dairy, sugar and chemicalized, artificial junk foods; consume less coffee,
                        alcohol and tobacco</p>

                    <p>Sleep is needed for restoring energy and emotional well-being. A study published in Harvard Medical School concludes that, among other things, sleep is essential for learning and memory, metabolism and weight and mood. </p>
