            <figcaption> This is a domestic cat.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family.</p>
    <p>The cat is either a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; latter ranges freely
        and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionshi
        and for their ability to hunt rodents. </p>
